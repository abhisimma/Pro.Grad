							<h3>Social</h3>
							<p>The knowledge about <strong>India's Size and Location</strong> is essential to me because it helps find location using latitudes and longitudes by this I can go anywhere without even knowing the name of this place. Not only this it has given important lessons about our country's geographical features and what makes India different from the other countries.
								<br>
								<br>
							The knowledge regarding <strong>Democracy</strong> is important to me because it makes me understand how my country runs and what makes my country a democratic. It has thought important things which are very essential to learn as a citizen of India like what is our preamble, how can one person vote, what are my rights and responsibilities, etc. I could come to a conclusion that the best way to enhance freedom is through democracy. But what I found interesting was that every system has flaws. It can never be expected that something has to be perfect and if we look at other systems in the world, democracy is highly recommended for countries with huge economies and large populations. There are innumerable insights and philosophies to learn from democracy like it's structure, it’s core principles, it’s laws and rights and what not.

							<strong>The French revolution</strong> taught me unity, the sense of Justice, and the sense of nationalism. The need to stand up against the wrong in a unified manner becomes visible in the efforts of the French. Liberty, Equality and Fraternity are some of the major ideals of the revolution. I learned that autocracy is bad and equality towards the minor classes of today's world is inspired by the revolution.
								<br>
								<br>
							In the chapter <strong>PEOPLE AS RESOURCE</strong>, I learned that the quality of the country will only increase if the quality of the population is good with regards to the health, education, jobs and many other sectors.</p>
							<br>

							<br>
							<h3>Science</h3>
							<p>While learning the lesson <strong>Sustainable Management of Natural Resources</strong>, I developed self management skills but reducing my waste and reusing products. This skill is essential because of the global warming situation on earth.
								<br>
								<br>
							The understanding of the chapter <strong>Work, Power, and Energy</strong> could be useful to me because it is one of the main chapters coming in my engineering due to which if I learn this chapter properly it will help me learn the higher standard of this chapter easily.
								<br>
								<br>
							Learning the topic <strong>Sources of Energy</strong>, has taught using renewable sources of energy can reduce the effect and slow down global warming and can promise us a better tomorrow.
								<br>
								<br>
							The understanding of <strong>Force & Motion</strong> could be useful to me because all the content in this chapter has a direct connection to the 10 and 11 syllabi as well as my higher studies. Understanding the basics of the chapter would really help me understand physics of an object in a better way.
								<br>
								<br>
							The knowledge of the chapter, <strong>Matter in our Surroundings</strong>, I learn in this chapter is essential to me because it helps me understand how are my surroundings helping me to live as well as teaching me the science behind very little things that make our lives easy, like in summers why do we store water in mud pots, in winters how sweaters give our body warmth and how we curd out of milk.</p>
							<br>

							<br>
							<h3>Math</h3>
							<p>I developed critical thinking skills while solving complex problems and self-management skills by not being overwhelmed while understanding the problems because my math teacher is very co-operative and helps me whenever I need to be understood. The project july was a really big leap in my learning this year. I had gained immense knowledge because of that programme initiated by the school, it touched almost every topic, so it was a pretty good experience while learning math. I am very interested and looking forward for such opportunities again </p>
