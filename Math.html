							<h3>Number Systems</h3>
							<p>A number system is defined as a system of writing to express numbers. It is the mathematical notation for representing numbers of a given set by using digits or other symbols in a consistent manner. It provides a unique representation of every number and represents the arithmetic and algebraic structure of the figures.</p>
							

							<h3>Lines &amp; Angles</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/laa.jpg" alt="" /></span>A line is a one-dimensional figure, which has length but no width. A line is made of a set of points which is extended in opposite directions infinitely. It is determined by two points in a two-dimensional plane. The two points which lie on the same line are said to be collinear points. An angle can be defined as the figure formed by two rays meeting at a common end point. There are different types of angles like acute angles, right angle, obtuse angles, straight angle, reflex angles. There are different pair of angles like adjacent angles, linear pair, etc.There are different properties regarding the lines and angles, for instance the angle-sum-property. </p>

							<h3>Triangles &amp; Quadrilaterals</h3>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/quad.png" alt="" /></span>A triangle is a three-sided polygon that closes in a space. It uses lines, line segments or rays (in any combination) to form the three sides. When three sides form and meet, they create three vertices. There are seven types of triangles which are equilateral, right isosceles, obtuse isosceles, acute isosceles, right scalene, obtuse scalene, and acute scalene. A quadrilateral is a polygon that has exactly four sides. This also means that a quadrilateral has exactly four vertices, and exactly four angles. Various shapes come under quadrilaterals, such as kite, parallelogram, rectangles, trapeziums, rhombus, squares, etc.</p>

							<h3>Heron's formula</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/hf.png"></span>Heron's formula also referred to as Hero's formula is named in honor of Hero of Alexandria who was a popular Greek mathematician. This formula is used to find out the area of a triangle when the length of three sides a, b, c, are given or known. Unlike other triangle area formulae (0.5 * base * height), there is no need to calculate angles or other distances in the triangle first.<br> In the formula, s is semi-perimeter, a is length of side a, b is length of side b, c is length of side c.</p>
							<h3>Constructions</h3>
								<p>"Construction" in Geometry means to draw shapes, angles or lines accurately. These constructions use only compass, straightedge (i.e. ruler) and a pencil. This is the "pure" form of geometric construction. In the chapter Constructions, is about constructing or building 2D figures like triangles, angles and many more. In this chapter, we learned the properties of few shapes and also learned how to construct them.</p>
